# TriviaGame

I am starting this read me file with basic layout of the application.

For the moment, I am planning on implementing this application using Bootstrap to help
structure the html portion.  Javascript will be used to handle the logic for the actual
trivia test.

Start with the intro screen.  This screen just has a "Start" button under the
"Totally Trivial Trivia" introduction.

When the Start button is pressed, the game screen will be output and the timer for the
game execution will be shown and start counting down.  

The game will end either when the timer expires or the user selects the "Done" button.
Upon completion of the game, the user will see a screen showing a message and their
score.  All Done!!  # correct answers..  # wrong answers..  # of unanswered questions..

A future enhancement to the implementation of this game will be to have the questions
table driven which will make it much easier to add/subtract/modify questions!!

Side note..  Part of this assignment mentioned adding a reference from our portfolio
project to this ..  SO..  I used a new version of my portfolio that I liked better
than the one I turned in.. The change there was to update the images from the portfolio
page to show images of the Crystal Game and this Trivia Game and also add links to the
images to open the sites in separate tabs.
